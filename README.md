## Project Description

<< Its a matching game where the tiles rest upside down and the goal is to try and match all the tiles by flipping two over to see if they match with their corresponding pair. If incorrect the tiles flip back upside down and you continue to search for a pair. >>

***    

## User Interface Design

- **Initial Concept**
  - << A wireframe or drawing of the user interface concept along with a short description of the interface. You should have one for each screen in your program. For example, if your program has a start screen, game screen, and game over screen, you should include a wireframe / screenshot / drawing of each one and a short description of the components. >>
    
    
- **Final GUI**
  - << You should also have a screenshot of each screen for your final GUI >>

***        

## Program Design
* Non-Standard libraries
    * << You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python. 
         For each additional module you should include
         - url for the module documentation
         - a short description of the module >>
* Class Interface Design
    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm. >>
        * ![class diagram](assets/class_diagram.jpg) 
* Classes
    * << You should have a list of each of your classes with a description. >>

## Project Structure and File List

The Project is broken down into the following file structure:

* main.py
* src
    * << all of your python files should go here >>
* assets
    * << all of your media, i.e. images, font files, etc, should go here) >>
* etc
    * << This is a catch all folder for things that are not part of your project, but you want to keep with your project >>

## Tasks and Responsibilities 

   * Cody: Responsible for easy.py, medium.py, hard.py
   * Yishi(Rocky): Responsible for .

## Testing

* << We tested as we created the buttons and adjusted the grid size. When we made the first button we tested to see if our button works, we then tested as we made tiles flip over. Then we would test as we increase the size or alter the code. >>
